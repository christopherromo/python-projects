## Project Overview

This a collection of Python projects from various classes I took at UCCS. In "Python Programming" (CS 3080), I learned the basics of Python. I had already been familiar with things like control structures and object-oriented programming, so a lot of this class was learning Python syntax and rules. In "Discrete Structures" (CS 2150), I was introduced to Jupyter Notebooks, where I explored topics like sequences, propositional logic, graphs, and more. In "Computational Linear Algebra" (CS 2300), I explored transformations and matrix math through libraries like `numpy`. In "Design & Analysis of Algorithms" (CS 4720), I explored different algorithms and their time complexity differences. In "Computer Architecture I" (CS 4200), I built a branch predictor program that shows branch prediction accuracy. In "Computability, Automata, Formal Languages" (CS 4700), I built a DFA program that accepts a DFA as input and accepts strings if they are in the provided language. Over these various classes, I have gotten comfortable with Python and with the many topics I explored.

2. Open the `python-projects` directory in Visual Studio Code.
    - Ensure `Python` and the `Python Extension Pack` for VS Code is installed.
    - Alternatively, you can use any other code editor that can run Python code.

3. Run the following command to install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Navigate to the desired Python program.

5. Click the run button in the editor to run the file.
